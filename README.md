## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

# 🧱 BrickChain

**Tokenizing Nigeria's Real Estate, One Property at a Time.**

BrickChain is a multi-tenant blockchain-powered real estate investment platform that enables realtors and landlords across Nigeria to tokenize their properties and allow users from anywhere in the world to invest fractionally, earn yield, and trade property-backed tokens in a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace.





## 🚀 Project Overview

Real estate in Nigeria is plagued by high entry barriers, limited transparency, and extreme illiquidity. BrickChain solves this by leveraging blockchain to democratize access to property investment and enable instant liquidity through tokenized real-world assets (RWA).





## 🧠 Key Features

- **Property Tokenization**  
  Realtors tokenize properties into ERC-20 tokens (e.g., 1 token = ₦1 or $1), representing fractional ownership.

- **Stablecoin Payments**  
  Investors buy tokens using MockUSDT (a test stablecoin deployed on-chain).

- **P2P Marketplace**  
  Investors can list and trade property tokens with each other.

- **Staking/Yield System**  
  Token holders can stake tokens to earn yield (e.g., 5% APY), simulating passive income from rental properties.

- **Role-Based Access Control**  
  Realtors and Admins are authenticated and authorized via smart contract-controlled roles.

- **Registry System**  
  A verified list of approved real estate listings and their token contracts.

| `MockUSDT.sol`          | A stablecoin used for buying/selling and yield payout                   |





## 🧩 System Design Overview

![System Design]

1. Realtors (e.g., Baba Kasali in Lagos) apply and get verified.
2. Admin approves listing → property gets tokenized.
3. Investors (e.g., Garba in Enugu) use MockUSDT to buy tokens.
4. Investors can stake tokens or trade them on the marketplace.
5. All interactions are tracked and verified on-chain.





## 🧪 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)



### Steps



1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChainBuildersBrickchain
   cd contract
   cd frontend

2. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev



3. Deploy contracts with Foundry


cd contracts
forge build
forge deploy --rpc-url <BASE_RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>




📌 Why BrickChain?
Gives Nigerians across the world access to fractional property investment.

Unlocks liquidity for realtors, bypassing slow and costly banks.

Bridges Web3 innovation with real-world economic problems.

Puts transparency and decentralization at the heart of real estate.




🌍 Case Study: Nigeria
Baba Kasali tokenizes his Lagos duplex for ₦80M (80,000 tokens).

Mazi Okafor in Abuja buys 5,000 tokens using USDT.

Garba in Enugu stakes his 2,000 tokens to earn passive income.

The community now has real, liquid ownership in properties they’d never afford traditionally.
